# Downloader
To download the downloader, click the "Github Downloader.jar" link then click "view raw". Alternatively, you can use the Github Downloader to download another Github Downloader for some reason.

Since this was written in Java and contains no hardcoded file paths, it should work on any operating system that is running Java 8-ish or higher. I have seen it work on a mac and it definitely works on my pc so... there you go!
